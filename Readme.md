# CoMo Richweb Raffle App
This app is for the CoMo Richweb usergroup raffles. It works by simply searching for tweets with the hashtag #comorichweb and then randomly selects a user from that set.

## Running it
The application is written using coffee-script on the serverside and the client side. It requires node.js, coffeescript and npm installed to run. 

From the project directory, first install the dependancies:
    `npm install coffee-script`
    `npm install express`
    `npm install jade`
    `npm install stylus`

Then to run the app:
    `coffee app.coffee`

That's it. Please feel free to fork and make additions. ;)
